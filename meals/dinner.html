      <h2>Quesadillas</h2>
      <img src="../img/fillerImg.png" alt="quesadilla" />
      <div>
        - 1 tortilla <br />
        - 1/2 c grated cheese* <br />
        - 1/4 c beans -- drained, rinsed, and cooked (I prefer black beans)
        <br />
        - 1 avocado, sliced, for serving (optional) <br />
        - Preferred amount of sour cream, for serving (optional) <br />
        1. Heat a medium skillet over medium heat. Warm your tortilla for about
        30 seconds, flipping halfway. Flip once more, then sprinkle one-half of
        the tortilla with about half of the cheese <br />
        2. Cover the cheese evenly with the beans. Sprinkle the remaining cheese
        over the fillings, and fold over the empty side of the tortilla to
        enclose the fillings. Carefully flip it with a spatula <br />
        3. Let the quesadilla cook until golden and crispy on the bottom, about
        one to two minutes, turning the heat down if necessary, then flip it and
        cook until the second side is golden and crispy <br />
        4. Immediately remove the skillet from the heat and transfer the
        quesadilla to a cutting board. Let it cool for a minute to give the
        cheese time to set, then use a chef's knife to slice it into four
        pieces. Serve with avocado and sour cream if using <br />

        - 1-8 medium potatoes, washed and pierced 5-6 times with a fork <br />
        - Sour cream for serving (optional) <br />
        1. Place 1 cup cold water in the inner pot of pressure cooker pan and
        place trivet in instant pot. Note: Use 1.5 cups of cold water in an
        8-quart Instant Pot. <br />
        2. Add the potatoes carefully on trivet (stacking on top of each other
        if needed). <br />
        3. Place the lid on the instant pot and seal the valve. <br />
        4. Hit the manual or pressure cook button and be sure HIGH pressure is
        selected. Adjust cook time to 12 minutes. <br />
        5. Once cook time has elapsed, allow pressure to naturally release for
        at least 10 minutes before doing a quick release of pressure. Remove
        potatoes from Instant Pot and serve right away for best results. <br />
