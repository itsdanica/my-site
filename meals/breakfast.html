        - 1 frozen banana, sliced into halves or thirds for easy blending <br />
        - 1 T cacao powder or unsweetened cocoa powder <br />
        - 2 T peanut butter <br />
        - 1 t vanilla extract <br />
        - 1/2 c milk of choice or 1/4 c milk of choice and 1/4 c plain yogurt**
        (best with unsweetened almond milk, in my opinion) <br />
        - Preferred amount of spinach (optional -- I usually use a handful)
        <br />
        1. Blend until smooth and drink right away for best results (you can put
        it in the fridge for a while if you don't want to drink it immediately,
        but it won't stay good like that for long) <br />
        (Tip: if your blender has measurements on the sides, put the milk in
        first so you won't have to use a measuring cup) <br />
