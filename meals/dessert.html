      <h2>Sourdough Biscotti</h2>
      <img src="../img/fillerImg.png" alt="sourdough biscotti" />
      <div>
        - 1/4 c olive oil <br />
        - 1 1/3 c brown sugar, packed <br />
        - 2 eggs <br />
        - 1 t vanilla extract <br />
        - 1 T almond extract <br />
        - 1/2 c sourdough discard <br />
        - 2 1/2 c all-purpose flour <br />
        - 3/4 t unrefined sea salt <br />
        - 1 c raw whole almonds <br />
        Optional chocolate dip: <br />
        - 8 oz semi sweet baker's chocolate* <br />
        - 1/4 tsp coconut oil <br />
        1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees and arrange raw almonds on a sheet
        tray prepared with parchment. <br />
        2. Once the oven is preheated, toast the almonds for 8-12 minutes. Set
        the almonds aside to cool slightly and then coarsely chop them. <br />
        3. Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle
        attachment, mix together olive oil and brown sugar. Add eggs one at a
        time and mix well. Scrape down the sides as you go. <br />
        4. Next, add vanilla extract, almond extract and sourdough discard. Mix
        again. Add the flour and salt and mix for a few rotations until just
        combined. <br />
        5. Pour in the coarsely chopped almonds and give it another few turns to
        mix. Take care not to over mix the dough. <br />
        6. On the same (cooled) sheet tray you previously used, form the dough
        into 2 equal sized logs approximately 3 1/2 to 4 inches wide. Once the
        logs are formed, chill the dough for 30 minutes. <br />
        7. Increase the oven temperature to 350 and bake the logs for 30
        minutes. Rotate the sheet tray at the 15 minute mark to achieve an even
        bake.
        <br />
        8. Remove the sheet tray from the oven and allow the logs to cool for
        15-20 minutes, then use a serrated knife to carefully cut thin slices of
        biscotti 1/2" to 3/4" thick. <br />
        9. Arrange the slices on a baking sheet and place back in the oven for
        15-25 minutes (depending on how thin/thick you've sliced them). Flip
        them halfway through baking and give the middle a tap to see if it's
        crisping up. <br />
        10. Once they are crispy and baked in the center, remove from the oven
        and allow them to fully cool. <br />
        11. Melt chocolate over a double boiler and dip the biscotti, scraping
        of the excess chocolate, and then set on parchment for the chocolate to
        cool and set. <br />
